### What It Does
MyGrades is an application for students. MyGrades keeps track of the grades students receive in courses and calculates GPA. The "What Do I Need" feature allows a student to calculate a grade that they need to get on an upcoming assignment (homework, exam, project, etc.) in order to get a specific grade (that the user inputs) in the course.
