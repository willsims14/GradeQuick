# MyGrades
#### Will Sims, March, 2017

### What It Does
MyGrades is an application for students. MyGrades allows a user to keeps track of the grades he or she receive in their courses and calculates GPA. The "What Do I Need" feature allows a student to calculate a grade that they need to get on an upcoming assignment (homework, exam, project, etc.) in order to get a specific grade (that the user inputs) in the course.

### Dependencies
You need a few things in order to download and run MyGrades:
1. A [*Firebase*](https://firebase.google.com/) database to store user grades. Once you have created the Firebaes database and have your keys, create this file (with your own keys): ```app/values/fb-creds.js```

    ```fb-creds.js
    "use strict";

    app.constant('FBCreds', {
        apiKey:      "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        authDomain:  "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        databaseURL: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }); 
    ```
2. [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/) was used to install and manage dependencies
    * ```cd lib```
    * ```npm install```
* _If you're using [Bower](https://bower.io/), be sure to change the <script> tags in index.html to reflect the correct filepaths._
